 Lower level overviews can be found in the final report PDF.

 * Task 1 models a 6 DOF robot arm traversing 2D space with obstacles using PRM and RRT
 * Task 2 models a 2D robot navigating obstacels using the potential field method
 * Task 3 models a flexible needle moving by obstacles using the unicycle model and RRT
 * Task 4 is an expansion on task 1 but into 3D using RRT

Each example comes with the required code to run in Matlab as well as videos showcasing their solution making abilities.
